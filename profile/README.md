# POP - Packages Of PHP

At the core, POP is a package manager for PHP. It was designed to be easier to use than tools like composer, and to be able to make it easier for people to bundle all their dependencies into their projects so it can be deployed with ease, without having to install a third party software on the deployment server. This is ideal for when you are limited to use a managed web-host that only accepts plain php files.
